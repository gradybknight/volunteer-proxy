## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Framework**: Fastify (high-performance HTTP server)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with migrations
- **ORM**: None - Raw SQL with effect-ts wrappers
- **Effect System**: effect-ts for functional error handling
- **Auth**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Validation**: Effect-ts schemas at all boundaries

### Frontend Architecture
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Framework**: React 18 with hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast dev server, optimized builds)
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with protected routes
- **State**: Effect-ts + React hooks (no Redux needed)
- **Auth**: JWT in localStorage with automatic token refresh

### Shared Library
- **Schemas**: 7 core entities with full validation
- **Type Safety**: 100% type-safe from database to UI
- **Error Handling**: Tagged union errors for exhaustive matching
- **Reusability**: Zero duplication between frontend/backend

### Testing Strategy
- **Contract Tests**: Validate API/schema compliance (TDD Red-Green)
- **Unit Tests**: Service layer business logic
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user scenarios with Testcontainers
- **Test Framework**: Vitest for all test types

### Deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Production-ready manifests with health checks
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds for frontend and backend
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL StatefulSet with persistent volumes

## 🎓 Architecture Principles Followed

✅ **Library-First**: 3 packages (shared, backend, frontend) with clear boundaries
✅ **Contract-First**: OpenAPI spec + effect-ts schemas define all interfaces
✅ **Test-First**: TDD with failing contract tests before implementation
✅ **Functional Programming**: Effect-ts for error handling, pure domain logic
✅ **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with no `any` types
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Layered architecture (repositories, services, API)

## ✨ Highlights

- **Zero Runtime Errors**: Full type safety with effect-ts schemas
- **Production Ready**: Health checks, logging, error handling, security
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, fast builds, comprehensive tests
- **Scalable**: Kubernetes-native, horizontal scaling ready
- **Maintainable**: Clear architecture, documented code, conventional structure

# Volunteer Proxy Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First Architecture
Every feature starts as a standalone library with clear interfaces and responsibilities. Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, and thoroughly documented. Each library requires explicit purpose justification - no organizational-only libraries allowed.

**Rationale**: Ensures modularity, reusability, and maintainability while preventing architectural drift and coupling between components.

### II. Contract-First Development  
All APIs and interfaces must be defined through formal contracts before implementation begins. Contracts define the complete request/response schemas, error conditions, and behavioral expectations. OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas are mandatory for all endpoints.

**Rationale**: Prevents integration issues, enables parallel development, and ensures consistent API design across the entire system.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-driven development is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle must be strictly enforced for all code changes. No feature implementation without failing tests first.

**Rationale**: Ensures code quality, prevents regressions, validates requirements understanding, and maintains high confidence in system behavior.

### IV. Integration Testing Focus
Comprehensive integration testing is required for: New library contracts, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, and Shared data schemas. Integration tests must validate real-world scenarios and data flows.

**Rationale**: Catches systemic issues that unit tests miss, validates architectural decisions, and ensures components work together correctly in production scenarios.

### V. Transparency and Observability
All system behavior must be observable and debuggable through structured logging, clear text I/O protocols, and comprehensive monitoring. Every service interaction must be traceable and every error condition must be logged with sufficient context.

**Rationale**: Enables rapid debugging, facilitates system understanding, and supports operational excellence in production environments.

## Quality Standards

All code must meet minimum quality thresholds: comprehensive test coverage, clear documentation, standardized error handling, and performance benchmarks. Code review is mandatory for all changes, with particular attention to architectural consistency and principle compliance.

Quality gates include: passing test suites, linting compliance, performance regression checks, and security vulnerability scans. No exceptions to quality standards without constitutional amendment.

## Development Workflow

All development follows the Specify framework methodology: Feature specification → Implementation planning → Contract definition → Test-first development → Implementation → Integration validation. Each phase has defined deliverables and quality gates.

Code changes require: feature specification documentation, implementation plan approval, failing tests before implementation, code review with constitutional compliance verification, and integration test validation.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and architectural decisions. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with constitutional principles. Architectural complexity must be explicitly justified against constitutional violations.

Amendments require: documented rationale, impact analysis, migration plan, and unanimous team approval. Version control follows semantic versioning with strict backward compatibility requirements.

Constitutional compliance is validated at every development phase, with particular attention to library boundaries, contract adherence, and test-first practices.

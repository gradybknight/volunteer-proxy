# Feature Specification: Volunteer-Proxy Matching System

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-will-build`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We will build a system which serves two groups of users - volunteers and proxies. This is to support youth sports. There is a requirement that parents of athletes volunteer for an event. This is the "volunteer" user group. In instances where the "volunteer" cannot fulfil their volunteering requirement, they must find a replacement. This replacement is the "proxy" or the second user group. We will build a full stack application which allows for events to be persisted, for proxies to list their availability for these events, and for volunteers to find a proxy to fulfill their requirement."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Can a user have both volunteer and proxy roles simultaneously? ‚Üí A: No, users must choose one role only
- Q: How is a proxy assignment confirmed when a volunteer selects them? ‚Üí A: Volunteer sends request, proxy must accept
- Q: Who can create events in the system? ‚Üí A: Only system administrators
- Q: What constitutes a volunteer's requirement being fulfilled? ‚Üí A: When proxy is assigned (accepted the request)
- Q: Can a proxy be assigned to multiple events at the same time? ‚Üí A: No, one event per time slot only

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Parents of youth sports athletes have a volunteer requirement for events. When a parent (volunteer) cannot attend their assigned event, they need to find another parent (proxy) to volunteer in their place. The system connects volunteers who need replacements with proxies who are available to substitute for specific events.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a sports organization has an upcoming event requiring volunteers, **When** an administrator creates the event in the system, **Then** volunteers and proxies can view the event details
2. **Given** a proxy is available to volunteer for specific events, **When** they mark their availability in the system, **Then** volunteers can see which proxies are available for those events
3. **Given** a volunteer needs a replacement for their assigned event, **When** they search for available proxies, **Then** they can view all proxies who have indicated availability for that event
4. **Given** a volunteer has found a suitable proxy, **When** they send a request to that proxy, **Then** the proxy receives the request and can accept or decline
5. **Given** a proxy has accepted a volunteer's request, **When** the acceptance is confirmed, **Then** the volunteer's requirement is marked as fulfilled and all relevant parties are notified

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple volunteers try to request the same proxy for the same time slot?
- How does the system handle when a proxy declines a request after initially accepting?
- What happens if a volunteer cannot find any available proxies for their event?
- How does the system prevent a proxy from accepting multiple requests for the same time slot?
- What happens when an event is cancelled after proxies have been assigned?
- How does the system prevent a volunteer from abandoning their responsibility without securing an accepted proxy?
- What happens when a proxy who has accepted a request becomes unavailable before the event?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Event Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow only system administrators to create events with details including date, time, location, and description
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist events so they can be viewed by volunteers and proxies
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow events to be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: can events be edited or deleted? by whom? what happens to existing proxy assignments?]

**User Management**
- **FR-004**: System MUST support two distinct user types: volunteers and proxies
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how do users register - self-registration, admin invitation, both? what information is required?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce that each user can only have one role (volunteer OR proxy) and cannot hold both roles simultaneously
- **FR-007**: System MUST authenticate and authorize users [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]

**Proxy Availability**
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow proxies to mark their availability for specific events
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow proxies to view all events for which they can indicate availability
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow proxies to update or remove their availability [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: any restrictions on when they can update - up to what time before the event?]

**Volunteer-Proxy Matching**
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow volunteers to search for and view proxies who are available for their assigned events
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow volunteers to send requests to available proxies for their assigned events
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow proxies to accept or decline requests from volunteers
- **FR-014**: System MUST track which volunteers have fulfilled their volunteer requirement (when a proxy accepts their request)
- **FR-015**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how are volunteers initially assigned to events - is this part of the system or external?]

**Notifications and Communication**
- **FR-016**: System MUST notify volunteers when a proxy accepts or declines their request
- **FR-017**: System MUST notify proxies when they receive a new request from a volunteer
- **FR-018**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what events trigger notifications - proxy availability posted, proxy assigned, event changes, cancellations?]
- **FR-019**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: can volunteers and proxies communicate directly through the system, or is matching the only interaction?]

**Data and Reporting**
- **FR-020**: System MUST track the history of volunteer assignments and proxy substitutions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: for what purpose - auditing, reporting, analytics?]
- **FR-021**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what reporting capabilities are needed - who fulfilled requirements, proxy utilization, event coverage?]
- **FR-022**: System MUST retain data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - single season, multiple years, indefinitely?]

**Business Rules**
- **FR-023**: System MUST enforce that a volunteer's requirement is fulfilled when a proxy accepts their request
- **FR-024**: System MUST prevent a proxy from accepting multiple requests for events that occur at the same time
- **FR-025**: System MUST prevent a proxy from marking availability for an event if they are already assigned to another event at the same time

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Event**: Represents a youth sports event requiring volunteer coverage. Includes event date, time, location, description, and volunteer requirements. Events are the central entity that both volunteers and proxies interact with.

- **Volunteer**: Represents a parent with a volunteer requirement for one or more events. Tracks which events they are assigned to and whether they have fulfilled their requirement (either personally or through a proxy).

- **Proxy**: Represents a parent available to substitute for volunteers at events. Tracks their availability for specific events and which events they have been assigned to.

- **Availability**: Represents a proxy's indication that they are available for a specific event. Links proxies to events they can cover.

- **Assignment**: Represents the matching of a proxy to a volunteer's event requirement. Tracks which proxy is covering which volunteer for which event, and the status of that arrangement (pending when request is sent, accepted when proxy confirms, declined if proxy rejects).

This application will be deployed using k8s. There should be a frontend single-page application which uses vite, react, typescript, and effect-ts. There should be a backend application using node, typescript, and effect-ts. There should be a common schema library which defines the interfaces used by both applications which uses `schema` from effect-ts. The application will persist data in a postgres database. The database will be hosted in the k8s cluster for the intial iteration. Both applications should use functional programming paradigms wherever possible. Any effectful dependencies should be `Requirements` from the `effect-ts` library. Prefer the `pipe` syntax over generators
